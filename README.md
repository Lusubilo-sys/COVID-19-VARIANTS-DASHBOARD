# COVID-19-VARIANTS-DASHBOARD
**TIME PERIOD** – ```Jan 2022``` <br/>
<br/>
**Audience** - ```Ministry of Health``` <br/>
<br/>
**Goal** - ```To analyse the impact of the different variants of the Covid 19 virus in selected countries of the world.```.<br/>
<br/>
**Context** – The Covid -19 dashboard gave an overview of the Covid -19 variants impact in selected countries. The dashboard had country and variant slicers but also included an impact map which displays the impact by the size of the bubble so the user can visualize the countries side by side. The user is able to view a single variant/country or select multiple cases to gauge their impact. Further I included an impact gauge, with green being relatively low impact and red being significantly high. <br/>
